# Roblox Mobile vs PC Scripts

## Mobile Platform Limitations
Roblox scripts on mobile devices are limited due to system restrictions and security controls. 
Most mobile platforms do not support advanced executors or background script execution. 
This makes testing and running scripts more restricted compared to PC.

## PC Advantages
PC platforms provide better flexibility for learning and testing Roblox scripts. 
Users have access to more tools and stable environments for scripting experiments. 
Performance and compatibility are generally better on PC systems.

## Executor Compatibility
Script executors often differ between mobile and PC platforms. 
Some executors work only on desktop systems and are not designed for mobile use. 
Understanding compatibility helps avoid crashes and errors.

## Performance Differences
Hardware power and system access affect how scripts behave on different devices. 
PC systems usually handle scripts more smoothly than mobile devices. 
Lower hardware limits on mobile can cause lag or script failure.

## Common User Mistakes
Many users try to run PC-based scripts on mobile platforms without checking compatibility. 
Using unverified scripts can lead to warnings or unexpected behavior. 
Learning basic differences helps reduce common errors.
